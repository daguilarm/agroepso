# Agropeso
This project is a first versión of my PhD project for the Universidad Miguel Hernández de Elche (Spain), in which a geolocated agricultural management software began to be drawn and developed at the plot level. 

The final project was built using other technologies like Laravel Nova, TailwindCSS, VueJS, etc... This repository is a first open source approach to the project. More info about the final project in:
